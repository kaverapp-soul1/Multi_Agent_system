Logline: A visionary industrial designer battles skepticism and the limitations of mass production to transform everyday objects into enduring works of art, proving that beauty and quality can be accessible to all and shaping the aesthetic of modern America.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act 1: The Visionary's Spark
Young Walter Dorwin Teague, an aspiring artist, is disillusioned by the drab, purely functional nature of early 20th-century mass-produced goods. He dreams of a world where everyday items are not just useful but beautiful and lasting. He struggles to define his nascent field, facing skepticism from manufacturers who prioritize cost over aesthetics and from artists who disdain mass production. A pivotal moment arrives when Teague lands his first significant commission, perhaps a challenging product for a burgeoning company, where he proves his concept of "visible rightness" can elevate a common item. This breakthrough marks the beginning of industrial design as a recognized and respected profession.

Act 2: Shaping the Modern World
Teague's reputation grows, and he takes on increasingly ambitious projects, collaborating with major companies like Eastman Kodak. He faces the constant challenge of integrating artistic vision with the realities of factory production, cost-efficiency, and consumer demand. He becomes a leading champion of mid-century modernism, bringing sleek, functional, and elegant designs to millions of American homes. This involves clashes with traditionalists who resist change and overcoming technical hurdles in manufacturing new materials and forms. Personal sacrifices or professional rivalries emerge as he dedicates himself to his work, striving to make "heirlooms out of mass-produced manufactured objects" while balancing the pressures to constantly innovate and deliver iconic designs.

Act 3: The Enduring Legacy
As his career progresses, Teague reflects on his profound impact, seeing his designs become ubiquitous and beloved across the nation. He faces a final, monumental challenge, perhaps a major exhibition like the New York World's Fair or a particularly complex design project such as the steel-legged Steinway piano, which solidifies his legacy as the "Dean of Industrial Design." He witnesses the profound impact of his work: how he democratized good design, making beauty accessible to everyone, and how he truly created "heirlooms" that transcended their utilitarian purpose. The film concludes with Teague looking at a world transformed by his vision, knowing he built a profession and left an indelible mark on American culture, proving that design could elevate the everyday.
