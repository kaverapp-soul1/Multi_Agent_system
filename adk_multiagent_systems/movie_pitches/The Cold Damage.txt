Logline: Amidst a collapsing dynasty and a devastating plague, a brilliant physician defies ancient dogma to revolutionize medicine, saving countless lives and earning his place as the immortal "Sage of Medicine."

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act I: The Gathering Storm
The Eastern Han dynasty crumbles under political strife and corruption, leaving its people vulnerable. Young Zhang Zhongjing, a gifted but unconventional physician, is introduced, often clashing with rigid traditional medical practices. He witnesses the horrifying onset of a mysterious, deadly epidemic sweeping across the land, claiming lives indiscriminately. Driven by compassion and a thirst for knowledge, Zhang Zhongjing dedicates himself to understanding and combating the illness, often working in isolation or with a small, loyal group of apprentices, meticulously observing symptoms and experimenting with herbal remedies. His early efforts are met with skepticism and resistance from established authorities.

Act II: The Crucible of Crisis
The plague intensifies, becoming a widespread catastrophe that threatens to decimate the population. Zhang Zhongjing faces immense pressure, personal loss (perhaps a loved one succumbs to the illness), and outright hostility from those who fear his innovative methods or see him as a threat to their own power. Through tireless research, daring experimentation, and a profound understanding of the human body, he makes a groundbreaking discovery â€“ a key principle of diagnosis or a potent combination of herbs that offers a glimmer of hope. He begins to successfully treat patients, but the challenge remains to convince a skeptical world and disseminate his life-saving knowledge amidst the chaos. He starts compiling his vast medical insights into a comprehensive text, laying the foundation for his enduring legacy.

Act III: The Sage's Legacy
Zhang Zhongjing's treatments prove undeniably effective, stemming the tide of the epidemic in regions where his methods are adopted. He faces a final, formidable challenge, perhaps a political decree that threatens to suppress his work, or a personal sacrifice required to ensure his knowledge survives the turbulent times. Despite the ongoing collapse of the Han dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing completes his magnum opus, the "Treatise on Cold Damage and Miscellaneous Disorders," a revolutionary text that codifies his principles of differential diagnosis and treatment. The film concludes with a powerful sense of his lasting impact, showing his teachings being passed down through generations, his methods continuing to save lives, and his enduring recognition as the "Sage of Medicine," a beacon of scientific advancement and humanitarian spirit against the backdrop of historical turmoil.
